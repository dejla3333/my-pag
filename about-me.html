   <h1>About me</h1> 
</body>
<p>Hi! I'm Dajla from Farah, Afghanistan. I'm 15 years old and currently a 9th-grade student. I come from a quiet city with deep stories and warm-hearted people. I’ve always been curious about the world beyond the walls of my classroom — especially when it comes to stories, emotions, and the power of words.</p>
<p>One day, I hope to become a person who can touch lives with thoughts and creativity — maybe through writing, maybe through something else I haven’t discovered yet. I love rainy days, classic books, and moments that make you pause and feel. This page is a small reflection of who I am today, and a beginning of who I might become.</p>
